# Image Classification on Amazon SageMaker

This project demonstrates image classification using Amazon SageMaker. The script covers data download, preprocessing, visualization, SageMaker setup, model training, deployment, and making predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Amazon SageMaker account
- AWS credentials configured locally

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install tqdm sagemaker matplotlib
Ensure your AWS credentials are set up.

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Usage
Run the image_classification.py script:
bash
Copy code
python image_classification.py
Follow the prompts in the script to download data, preprocess it, set up SageMaker, train the model, deploy it, and make predictions.
